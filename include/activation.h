/**
 * Hyperbolic Tangent Function.
 *
 * tanh(x) is a nonlinear activation function, with its center at 0 and
 * its value ranging between â€“1 to 1.
 *
 * tanh(x) can be expressed in numerous ways depending on the need, it can be
 * defined using the exponential function in several slightly different but
 * equivalent forms. Here are three common representations:
 *
 * 1. Basic Exponential Definition:
 *    tanh(x) = (exp(x) - exp(-x)) / (exp(x) + exp(-x))
 *
 * 2. Symmetric Form Definition:
 *    tanh(x) = (1- exp(-2*x)) / (1 - exp(-2*x))
 *
 * 3. Alternate Symmetric Form:
 *    tanh(x) = (exp(2*x) - 1) / (exp(2*x) + 1)
 *
 * The form #2 is particularly useful for computing tanh(x) for large negative
 * x values because it avoids large exponential values that could lead to
 * numerical overflow.
 *
 * The form #3 is beneficial for computing tanh(x) for
 * large positive x values, mitigating issues with numerical underflow that
 * might occur when x is negative and large in magnitude.
 *
 * These three forms showcase the flexibility in representing the hyperbolic
 * tangent function using exponential functions, each of these expressions
 * provides the same hyperbolic tangent function, each being particularly
 * useful under different computational circumstances.
 *
 * Note: We define the function as 'static inline' to enhance performance
 * and reduce execution time. This choice is made because the function is
 * lightweight and frequently utilized, allowing it to be seamlessly integrated
 * into the code where it is invoked. Consequently, this approach minimizes the
 * overhead typically incurred by function calls.
